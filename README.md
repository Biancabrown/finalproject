# Bianca Brown's Final Project

## Introduction
The goal of this study was to investigate how nutrient concentrations affects microbial diversity, by assessing sites varying distances from Combine Sewers.
The visualization and its associated materials such as the data can be viewed here: https://github.com/Biancabrown/finalproject .

## The data
The data was collected as apart of one of my undergraduate works. Consequently, this means that it is unpublished. The raw data:
structured data
The raw data consits of all the microbe communities that were seqeunced at each of our collection. In total, that resulted in over 500,000 individual micobes. The pipeline used for the analysis presented this data in txt with the site name, species name, and abundance of each species.
The data used for the visualization was only for two sites Black Basin and Hawtree. 

## Background
In a field where there is so much potential for dynamic data visualization, it is lacking. There are several examples of static microbial data presentations.The following are from two of my favorite microbial community papers. 
First Paper

The shortcoming of these paper, and with alot of microbial sequencing papers, is that the authors attempt to show majority of thier data. The readers are inundated with data, that they have parse out independently. The authors attempt to make that experience easier by guiding the readers to important parts of the data, however, these study usually consits of a mutlitude of graphs, charts and comparisons that can easily confuse the reader. 

## Microbial Community associated with Jamaica Bay

### Mapping of data to aesthetics
The data is mapped to a pie chart. Clicking on the pie chart shows the percentages, and by clicking on the legend you can change the microbial community composition. 
### Filtering

Data filtering was done prior to mapping. I only used two sites that is associated with my data. Also I only used species of microbes with abudances over 500. 

### Extra ink

The background colors area added for aestetics.

### Perspective

In this project the reader is able to explore and compaare the different communities by clicking buttons to choose the site of interest. They can also manipulate the compisition of the microbial community.

## Assessment

The visualization was extremely successfully in adding new perspective to the data. However, I was limited in the amount of data points I could have added to the pie chart. With that the data shown was manipulated. My future direction will be to figure out how better I can expand the data to include all my data points, and how to make a more interactive map.
