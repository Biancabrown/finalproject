# Bianca Brown's Final Project

## Introduction
The goal of this study was to investigate how nutrient concentrations affects microbial diversity, by assessing sites varying distances from Combine Sewers.
The visualization and its associated materials such as the data can be viewed here: https://github.com/Biancabrown/finalproject .

## The data
The data was collected as apart of one of my undergraduate works. Consequently, this means that it is unpublished. The raw data:
structured data
The raw data consits of all the microbe communities that were seqeunced at each of our collection. In total, that resulted in over 500,000 individual micobes. The pipeline used for the analysis presented this data in txt with the site name, species name, and abundance of each species.
The data used for the visualization was only for two sites Black Basin and Hawtree. 

## Background
In a field where there is so much potential for dynamic data visualization, it is lacking. There are several examples of static microbial data presentations.The following are from two of my favorite microbial community papers. 
First Paper

The shortcoming of these paper, and with alot of microbial sequencing papers, is that the authors attempt to show majority of thier data. The readers are inundated with data, that they have parse out independently. The authors attempt to make that experience easier by guiding the readers to important parts of the data, however, these study usually consits of a mutlitude of graphs, charts and comparisons that can easily confuse the reader. 

## Microbial Community associated with Jamaica Bay

### Mapping of data to aesthetics

How will aesthetic attributes ( X / Y / color / shape / size /texture / etc ) will be mapped to the data?

### Filtering

Are data filtered? ie in some views are some data not mapped to particular attributes of the image? What is the goal of the filtering?

### Extra ink

Are there aesthetic attributes that are not mapped to the data? If so, what purpose do they serve ( redundancy for robustness / improve visual metaphor / but data in context / beauty / etc )?

Are any data mapped to more than one aesthetic attribute? Why?

### Perspective

In this project the reader is able to explore and compaare the different communities by 

## Assessment

Was the new visualization successful at providing insight that was not possible or more difficult with previous approaches?

What are the main limitations of new approach?

What are future directions this could go in?
